						<h2>Why do I want to work at Gigasavvy?</h2>
						<p>
							I see the work that we do as our gift, the gift that we give to the world. As a creative, I wake up every day with this insatiable desire to build, design, create, produce, and share my creations with the world.
							<br><br>

							I'm not looking for an easy job, in fact, I don't want it if its easy. I'm looking for my next big challenge.
							<br><br>

							Why would I be of value to Gigasavvy?
							<br><br>

							If you're looking for a "Yes" man, then stop reading here. I'm a challenger, I bring out the best ideas in myself, and in my teams by asking questions. I'm comfortable speaking up, and I want to be challenged, in fact I crave it.

							<br><br>

							Production is my gig, creativity is my passion, when others see chaos, I see patterns. I crave pressure, and handle it with grace while adapting to changes, and shifting gears as needed. I can talk to anybody, I'm outgoing, and I'm adaptable.
							<br><br>

							If you expect me to come up with great ideas on a regular basis... great. I expect that from myself and I am much harder on myself than you're likely ever going to be. But I challenge you to push me. Lets see just what we're capable of.						</p>

						<h2>What can your hobbies tell us that your resume can't?</h2>
						<p>What my  misses but I would love to share, is that I have a passion for woodworking.



							I believe that the home is a sacred space. Its where we go to relax, to recharge, it should be beautiful, it should soothe us. I believe in a world where we are intentional about who and what  we surround ourselves with. I believe in being material minded without being materialistic. I believe in enjoying the work you do, even if its hard.
							<br><br>
							When was the last time you ran your hands along something truly natural, not manufactured, but something from the earth? I believe in finding ways to feel that more often. I believe in reconnecting with the earth.
							<br><br>

							There is something primal and satisfying to me about sitting down with your family for dinner at a table you build with your bare hands. Not just a table you put together, but a table you envisioned, designed yourself, sourced your own salvaged materials to build, and then went down to the garage, and built with your bare hands (plus a lot of sawdust and sweat).
							<br><br>

							One of my biggest passions is woodworking. In my free time you can find me salvaging fallen trees (See image to the right), reclaiming old timbers, and kicking up sawdust and noise in my garage. I love making items for the home, things that I use every day, things that bring warmth into our home, things that bring me and my family utility.
							<br><br>


							My design style is a modern version of rustic industrial. I work exclusively with wood that I salvaged and reclaimed myself, I design and build my own furniture. I also love teaching my 5year old step daughter Hailgeigh how to do woodworking too and empowering her to follow her <a style="color:black; font-weight:bold" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ8sVkPlEMy/?taken-by=davidroostcreative">own creative endeavors.</a></p>

						<h2>Who is your personal hero (someone you know personally)? Why?</h2>
						<p>
							I've known Captain Taylor Giffen of the US Air Force, since we were both 4 years old. We've been best friends ever since. Taylor knew at age 4 he was going to be a pilot. Flying is his passion, there is nothing that makes him happier than soaring through the sky breaking the sound barrier, or entering space at 70,000 ft in his U2 (pictured behind him in this photo).
							<br><br>
							Taylor is an incredible human being, he has not only excelled at everything he's ever attempted, but he's risen to the elite ranks in more ways then I could do if I had 5 lifetimes.
							<br><br>

							But this is just the preamble to why he's my hero.
							<br><br>

							Taylor has arranged his entire life to support his pursuit of his passion, but not only that, Taylor is a good man. He is responsible,  and most importantly, he's humble. I don't know a single person out there who has more to brag about than Taylor, but if you drove with him on an 8hour road trip, he wouldn't say a single thing about his time in the most elite secret society in the country (skull and bones), he wouldn't tell you about how he's literally one of the best pilots in the entire world, and he wouldn't tell you about how he has had Nasa approach him to be an astronaut on the mission to mars. He would make dry humor jokes, and ask how YOU are doing.
							<br><br>

							The thing I respect the most about Taylor though, is that he simply outworks everyone else. Yes there is an element of talent he was born with, but I've never seen someone work harder at their goals than him.
							<br><br>

							"Could you be working harder towards your goals?" I ask myself this all the time when I think about Taylor. I am proud to call Taylor my friend.						</p>

						<h2>What is your at-bat song? </h2>

						<p><a style="color:black; font-weight:bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuyxX5P5Xug">BRING EM OUT</a>
							This song just gets me hyped.
							<br><br>
							There's a great backstory behind it too, I'd love to tell you over a beer sometime.						</p>

						<h2>Why did you get into this industry or why do you want to move into this industry?</h2>
						<p>
							It took me a long time to accept what my ethos was.
							<br><br>
							To use my skill as a creative, to bring people closer together. Thats how I communicate best. Sure I can use lots of words, but really, the most authentic way for me to communicate how I feel is visually, with an expresion of creativity to convey my idea, be it a graphic design, an illustration, a wood piece of furniture or art, a photo, ...
							<br><br>
							Sure I could tell you how amazing my most favorite IPA is from Coronado Brewery. But I can communicate much more effectively by taking a photo like this one I shot in my garage... Thirsty yet?

						<h2>Describe your ideal work environment. </h2>
						<p>
							I am a laid back intensity junkie. I bounce back and forth from extreme focus to chill and playful. This is my sweetspot.
							<br><br>
							I've been told that Einstein would work on intense theories of physics and relativity and when faced with a massive challenge, instead of forcing the answer when he was stuck, he would simply go take a break, and go sailing.
							<br><br>

							Often, while drifting along the shoreline the answer to his question would pop into his head, and he would turn back and finish his work.
							<br><br>

							This resonates with me and my workstyle.
							<br><br>

							My workstyle is best suited for an industry where results matter, but I can be free to work in my own way, to use my mind to challenge and influence the variables of the problem to create the best solution. The deadline will be met, because the client comes first, always. Sleep comes second.						</p>

						<h2>Why should we hire you?</h2>
						<p>Hire me if you're looking for a digital creative who has a passion for producing beautiful content. Someone who is relentless and won't quit until its perfect.
<br><br>
							Hire me if you want someone who is easy to get along with, makes the teams he is on all follow my lead and care, to care more about the project, find a special value in it, and have fun while doing it.
							<br><br>

							I may or may not be the right fit for Gigasaavy, but I'd like to talk more in person to find out. Because I'm excited about the opportunity to be a part of a team where tackling creative challanges, and producing creative content every single day is our goal.
							<br><br>

							This is what drives me. I'm a doer, a creative doer. This is what I love to do for work, its what I like to do for play, its what I like to do in my free time, and its what I'll stay up all night and sacrifice sleep for. Because I believe in it, and by doing it, I'm happy.
							<br><br>

							(To the right is my submission to the Canyon View Elementary schools - located in Irvine - new logo contest that is being voted on as we speak. While currently working full time, and attempting to launch a small business in my free time, and take care of my family, I was passionate about making this logo submission not just good, but up to MY standards. I stayed up ALL night to get this sent in by the deadline and I'm very proud of it. Even if I don't win, its ok, because I feel pride when I look at that logo.)
