						<h2>Why do I want to work at Gigasavvy?</h2>
						<p><br>
							I see the work that we do as our gift, the gift that we give to the
							world. As a creative, I wake up every day with this insatiable
							desire to build, design, create, produce, and share my creations
							with the world.
							<br><br>
							I'm looking for my next big challenge.
							<br><br>
							If you're looking for a "Yes" man, then stop reading here. I'm a
							challenger, I bring out the best ideas in myself, and in my teams
							by asking questions. I'm comfortable speaking up, and I want to
							be challenged, in fact I crave it.
							<br><br>
							I thrive on pressure, adapt well to change, and shifting gears as needed. I can talk to
							anybody, I'm outgoing, and I'm adaptable.
							<br><br>
							If you expect me to come up with great ideas on a regular basis...
							great. I challenge you to push me. Lets see just what we're capable of.						</p>

						<h2 style="color:white">What can your hobbies tell us that your resume can't?</h2>
						<p style="color:white"><br>I believe that the home is a sacred space. Its where we go to relax,
							to recharge, it should be beautiful, it should soothe us. The things we keep should reflect that.
							<br><br>
							There is something primal and satisfying to me about sitting down
							with your family for dinner at a table you build with your bare hands.
							Not just a table you put together, but a table you envisioned,
							designed yourself, sourced your own salvaged materials to build,
							and then went down to the garage, and built with your bare hands (plus a lot of sawdust and sweat).
							<br><br>
							One of my biggest passions is woodworking. In my free time you can
							find me salvaging fallen trees, reclaiming
							old timbers, and kicking up sawdust and noise in my garage.
							<br><br>
							My design style is a modern version of rustic industrial. I work
							exclusively with wood that I salvaged and reclaimed myself.</p>

						<h2>Who is your personal hero? Why?</h2>
						<p><br>
							I've known Captain Taylor Giffen of the US Air Force, since we were
							both 4 years old. We've been best friends ever since. Taylor knew at
							age 4 he was going to be a pilot. Flying is his passion, there is
							nothing that makes him happier than soaring through the sky breaking
							the sound barrier, or entering space at 70,000 ft in his U2 .
							<br><br>
							I look up to Taylor, he has committed his life to pursuing his passion,
							and he works harder and has sacrificed more than anyone would ever know
							to accomplish his goals. On top of that, he is the most humble man I know. This impresses me more than anything.
							<br><br>

							The thing I respect the most about Taylor though, is that he
							simply outworks everyone else. Yes there is an element of talent
							he was born with, but I've never seen someone work harder at their
							goals than him.
							<br><br>

							"Could you be working harder towards your goals?" I ask myself this
							all the time when I think about Taylor. I am proud to call Taylor my friend.</p>

						<h2>Why did you get into this industry or why do you want to move into this industry?</h2>
						<p><br>
							It took me a long time to accept what my ethos was.
							<br><br>
							To use my skill as a creative, to bring people closer together. Thats how I communicate best. Sure I can use lots of words, but really, the most authentic way for me to communicate how I feel is visually, with an expresion of creativity to convey my idea, be it a graphic design, an illustration, a wood piece of furniture or art, a photo, ...
							<br><br>
							Sure I could tell you how amazing my most favorite IPA is from Coronado Brewery. But I can communicate much more effectively by taking a photo like this one I shot in my garage... Thirsty yet?

						<h2>Describe your ideal work environment. </h2>
						<p><br>
							I am a laid back intensity junkie. I bounce back and forth from extreme focus to chill and playful. This is my sweetspot.
							<br><br>
							I've been told that Einstein would work on intense theories of physics and relativity and when faced with a massive challenge, instead of forcing the answer when he was stuck, he would simply go take a break, and go sailing.
							<br><br>

							Often, while drifting along the shoreline the answer to his question would pop into his head, and he would turn back and finish his work.
							<br><br>

							This resonates with me and my workstyle.
							<br><br>

							My workstyle is best suited for an industry where results matter, but I can be free to work in my own way, to use my mind to challenge and influence the variables of the problem to create the best solution. The deadline will be met, because the client comes first, always. Sleep comes second.						</p>

						<h2>Why should we hire you?</h2>
						<p><br>Hire me if you're looking for a digital creative who has a
							(stay up all night to get it down) kind of passion for producing
							beautiful content. Someone who is relentless
							and won't quit until its perfect.
							<br><br>
							Hire me if you want someone who is easy to get along with, makes
							the teams he is on all follow my lead and care, to care more about
							the project, find a special value in it, and have fun while doing it.
							<br><br>

							I may or may not be the right fit for Gigasaavy, but I'd like to
							talk more in person to find out.
