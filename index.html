    Number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width which is the
    width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. (There are corresponding
    height and device-height values, which may be useful for pages with elements that
     change size or position based on the viewport height.)
    The initial-scale property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    The maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable properties control how users
    are allowed to zoom the page in or out. -->

                <br><br>
                <p>My approach to design starts with a big cup of coffee, then we'll sit down and define the goal, drink more coffee, do research, specify the requirements, brainstorm solutions, get to work, drink more coffee, build prototypes, gather feedback, test, and refine the design.
                  <br><br>
                  If there's something I don't know how to do <span>(yet)</span> then I'll learn it on the fly.
                  <br><br>
                  Good design is messy. It takes time, but with organization and communication, deadlines will be met. For me it usually goes like this “I hate it <span>(but keep working on it),</span> I hate it <span>(but keep working on it),</span> I hate it <span>(but keep working on it),</span> then after I struggle with it long enough, eventually, I create something I love!"</p>

                <p>“If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far, go together.” <span> (my approach to teamwork)</span>
                  <br><br>
                One must communicate outside the realm of their specialization to be effective on a team. You must step outside of your own little world of focus and into someone else's, I might not always fully understand them, but I can communicate with them the needs of the project and the team better this way. <br><br>I prefer to work as a team, I want to be surrounded by people smarter than me.  <span>(This pulls me up, pushes me to grow)</span>  I thrive on pressure. I enjoy finding ways to resolve conflict amongst my teammates.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>There are always unanswerable questions and there is always pressure. <br><br>When I face adversity, I stay calm, break the problem down into pieces. <span>(Let the pressure be your motivator, not your handicap)</span> This is where I get to work gathering information, learning, asking people smarter than myself. <br><br>Steady consistent work yields solutions to even the most challenging problems. Communication <span> (with client + team)</span> minimizes frustrations and brings results.
                  <br><br>
                  You will never hear my say “that’s not my job, I won’t learn that.” I'm a lover of learning and exploring new concepts, processes, and skills.</p>

          <p style="max-width:100%;">In my current role as Lead Front-End Developer, we recently launched our first app in January 2018.
            <br><br>
            To fit the needs of our specific market, we chose to build a web-based instead of native app to make our software as accessible as possible across any device.
            <br><br>
            This industry disrupting software was designed for the niche market of compounding pharmacists.
            <br><br>
            Our goal was to provide a simple, fast and beautiful new way to access vital data in mere seconds in the demanding and competitive world of health care professionals.
            <br><br>
            Using jQuery Mobile as our foundation framework, and keeping data security at the forefront, we got to work.

            My role as head of all front-end development, and also all design and UI/UX was to design and build the most beautiful and functional experience for our customers as possible.
            <br><br>
            I prototyped, wifreframed, designed, and established a strong and consistient style. Once agreed upon, my back-end counterpart and I worked within a scrum style workflow to meet a challenging deadline.
           <br><br>
            The end result is a product we are all incredibly proud of, our software has been incredibly well-received by our pharmacists. We are currently working on our second generation of this software.
          <br><br>
          I also built and currently maintain our company website, which can be viewed here <a href="http://myusp800.com/"><span style="color: rgb(42,193,223);">myusp800.com</span></a>

            Empowering people to work with their hands and protecting our environment are two of my biggest passions.
            <br><br>
            To serve those two passions, I started my own business, selling an organic wood finish I invented.
            <br><br>
            Roostmade Company opened for business on February 1st, 2018.
            <br><br>
            Designed for cutting boards and woodworking, our organic wood finish is made in San Diego Ca.

          We partnered with a reforestation non-profit, <a href="https://edenprojects.org/"><span style="color: rgb(42,193,223);">Eden Projects</span></a> and now for every Roostmade product sold, three trees are planted.
          <br><br>
          In our first two months of business, we are happy to report that enough trees have been planted to remove 36.7 Tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.

                <p>"Aim For The Stars"
                  <br><br>

                  Simple, modern, clean lines. Vibrant colors, this mark is passionate, gender neutral, and expresses
                  the excitement around a child's eagerness to learn.
                  <br><br>
                  I wanted to make something that reminded me
                  of the energy I felt when I saw all of the kids entering class on the first day of school. The idea of
                  "Aim for the stars" is what I was thinking of when I created this, Canyon View is the perfect place
                  for a child to let their learning take off, and no matter where they go, they will have always started
                  their journey in learning at Canyon View. The idea of the star was central to this.

                  <br><br>The star is also a
                  rocket, launching into the sky with limitless potential just like our kids, you'll notice that the rocket
                  is being launched from two ridges that form a canyon, this represents the foothills of the canyon
                  which the school nestles up to in its landscape just a few hundred feet from campus.
                   <br><br>
                  The stars in the sky also have four points for a reason, they symbolize the school's S.T.A.R.
                  Philosophy as it also has four main points.</p>

                <h2>SF CITY Project Title</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>CLIENT</h3>
                <p>San Francisco City Football Club</p>
                <br>
                <h3>FOCUS</h3>
                <p>Brand Identity Guidelines | Custom Typography</p>
                <br>
                <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Rising up through the ranks, SFCFC’s primary goal is to elevate itself up
                  through the lower levels of professional soccer to reach Major League
                  Soccer status. To help the club reach these goals, I designed a complete
                  brand identity guidelines for the organization. The team was essentially
                  a small business startup and did not have the resources for a full time
                  designer, so they reach out to local freelancers to assist with their
                  grass roots marketing goals. The purpose of the brand identity guidelines
                  was to build a framework for any designer to use and be equipped with the
                  appropriate design standards, logos, colors, type-faces, and usage so that
                  as SFCFC elevates through the ranks of soccer, their visual marketing
                  communications will all be completely integrated to deliver the clubs same
                  consistent message.
                  <br><br>
                  Comprised of a sharpened logo as well as refined colors and typefaces,
                  this brand identity underscores the Club’s commitment to elevate San
                  Francisco above all else. These enhancements reinforce our core values
                  and allow the SF City brand opportunity for growth.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
                <p>I also took this opportunity to design my first font, “Urban Athletica – Roost”
                  <br><br>
                  A custom made typeface designed solely for exclusive use of San Francisco City
                  Football Club by David Roost in 2015. SF City prides itself on a style of play
                  described as “City Football”. This typeface is a representation of that style --
                  athletic and modern with an urban feel. Designed for maximum impact in the least
                  amount of space, this typeface still maintains readability. Each letter stands tall
                  and bold, reminiscent of city skyscrapers casting a shadow on themselves in the California sun.
                  <br><br>
                  The Urban Athletica - Roost typeface  ts best when placed snugly next to each other.
                  This typeface is to be used sparingly, selectively and strategically. Posters, digital
                  graphics, and advertisements are examples where this typeface may be used as a headline,
                  where all other text on the artwork should utilize other approved typefaces. This typeface
                  is reserved for speci c purposes and care needs to be taken to not use this typeface in excess.
                  <br><br>
                  Urban Athletica - Roost may be skewed/sheared vertically at an upward 15 degree angle when
                  appropriate. This is suggestive of the rapid growth of SF City and desire to further expand
                  the San Francisco soccer community. Urban Athletica - Roost is not meant to be transformed in
                  any other way, other than scaled larger or smaller with correct 1:1 (horizontal:vertical) proportions.</p>

                <p>“When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you
                  and me.” This Led Zeppelin song lyric was central to the love
                  that brought Ali and Geoff together. Her heart lies with the ocean,
                  and his lies with the mountains. When they got married they
                  reached out to me to officiate their marriage, and to design
                  them a symbolic logo to their relationship.  I’ve known them
                  from the first night they met and I took this project as a
                  fun challenge to design something significant to them.</p>

                <p>With the construction of Levi Stadium in Santa Clara for the
                  San Francisco 49ers, Tori Willis curated the museum and
                  historical bronze statues, in doing so she discovered a hidden
                  talent and passion for creating factual and accurate historical
                  statues.  This lead her to create a side business curating
                  factual and accurate historical bronze statues, and this business
                  needed a logo and brand direction that reflected her unique style.
                  Logo design, color palette, typography and a publication showcasing
                  her work were part of the scope of this project.</p>

                <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
                <p>"Find Your Greatness."
                  <br>This quote was the theme and guiding light of this project.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Since 1963 the Little League in the San Diego community of
                  University City has been a proud organization focused on the
                  development of young athletes and the fun of baseball. The UCLL put out
                  an ad for local artists to contribute work to turn an old and ugly storage
                  shed into a beautiful mural. The design part of this project was focusd
                  around creating something that would inspire the young athletes. Creating the
                  feeling of a "big" stadium, yet making it resemble the fence, backstop, and pressbox of
                  Fort Field proved to be a challenge, yet after many iterations, I was able to create something recognizable and iconic.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Stripping off years and years of paint and rust proved to be extremely challenging,
                  but after it was all said and done, the hard work was worth it. Two years later, the mural
                  is still in perfect condition, no staining or peeling from underlying rust. We've received so many
                  compliments on this project, and it was a delight to work with the community I grew up in to
                  create something special just for them and the organization that taught me how to play baseball also.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
                <p>Projects intended for myself are by far the most challenging for me to finish.
                  Branding myself with a look that I like has proven to be nearly impossible.
                  But if the project is for someone else I can knock it out like a machine, it's a weird phenomenon.
                  <br><br>
                  Two years ago I set my intentions to conquer this challenge. I created a
                  reminder on my phone to go off every single day. "Let's Inject some more
                  personality into your brand sir. Show off your style. Push yourself David."
                  The point was for me to basically nag myself until I did it. I considered
                  turning the reminder off many times.
                  <br><br>
                  The completion of my own personal portfolio website using my new #frontendwebdevelopment
                  skills I knew I needed a new custom look.
                  <br><br>
                  One morning in May, my hands lead me to create this, it was like they did the
                  work on their own as this design flowed through me, the inspiration wave hit,
                  and I rode it man. The funny thing is that day was exactly two years to the date
                  since I set the first reminder to get this done.
                  <br><br>
                  I choose to manage my mind in a bit of an unusual way, I might seem forgetful,
                  I'm a weirdo, I choose to not remember all of the little details. I just don't
                  have room in my head for everything. I can outsource the little details to post
                  it notes or Siri to remember for me. If I don't live intentionally to reserve a
                  peaceful clear space in my mind, my creativity couldn't flow through me like it
                  did that May morning. I know living this way might seem crazy to some.
                  But I have to be true to myself and if I can't create, then why live? It's my passion.
                  <br><br>
                  I present the new Roost logo, this little rooster is simple and unique, reflective
                  of my style, makes me happy, and is absolutely something I can envision being
                  emblazoned on the things I create, be it wood projects, my website, whatever.
                  <br><br>
                  I hope you enjoy my work.

                <p>The planners of this epic reunion reached out to me to create
                  visual hype, a giveaway sticker, and a cool logo for our ten
                  year high school reunion. Knowing me, I couldn't resist taking
                  this opportunity to challenge myself. I had been waiting for a
                  good opportunity to use a design style where I created something
                  using only circles and our Centurion mascot was the perfect design
                  challenge (see depiction in the images). I was very pleased with
                  the result of this project, and the visual branding of the event
                  was very well received. </p>

                <p>I've always been fascinated by photography. My instincts as a
                  designer lead me to always desire a certain type of photo to
                  perfectly compliment my design work. In 2010 I had the opportunity
                  to coordinate the team of photographers that contributed to the
                  Athletics Department for Fresno State. Working with these professionals
                  my curiosity turned into a professional passion, I learned the
                  ins and outs of full manual digital SLR photography,
                  light manipulation, post processsing, workflow, art direction
                  and the art of posing and working with a subject. I learned to
                  keep a camera in hand, and capture the moment as it unfolded,
                  as most moments can never be recreated. Fast, efficient, quality
                  photography, to make stunning images on a budget is my style.
                  <br><br>
                  You're likely to find me using unusual light sources, makeshift studios,
                  crouched in uncomfortable positions, or perched up on unstable objects
                  to create the look I want in photo. </p>

                <p>I took this passion and enthusiasm to my experience at The University of Arizona, where I majored in environmental and resource economics and management. As a student I was the  rst appointed Executive Director of the nation’s largest student-run student section and ticketing program, the Zona Zoo. I worked with the media on a daily basis, developing many strategic personal relationships, while also conducting many press conferences and interviews. In addition I created and executed numerous large-scale events, seeing them through from concept to completion. My decisions lead to record breaking sales, a boost in revenue of over $453,000 and increased Men’s Basketball attendance. I also have a history of exceeding targets and cultivating strong relationships as a fundraiser for the Wildcat Club, and as a salesman for the Arizona Cardinals football club.</p>

                <p>Fresno State athletics recruited me to come in and serve as marketing, media relations and events coordinator. In addition to that I ran all publications, photography and student ticketing and assisted with large fundraising endeavors. I worked and organized hundreds of events, I lead many projects, managed budgets and created a branding strategy to deliver a consistent look across all platforms. Most notably the Dog Pound student ticketing program. During my time the combined student revenues and fees more than doubled from $1.9M to $4.3M in two years.</p>

                <h2>STADIO</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>STADIO MARKETING CONSULTING</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Consumers make decisions because of how a brand makes them FEEL.
                  This is why as a business, we need not ask ourselves “What are we selling?”
                  but more importantly, “Why are we selling it?”

                  We are drawn to things that feel right, that feel good, often without being
                  able to explain exactly why. The limbic system is responsible for this. This
                  is the area of the brain that processes feelings, motivations, experiences
                  and memories of what is enjoyable and what is not. This part of the brain is
                  responsible for our decision-making, and it has no capacity for language. We
                  often do things simply because they “feel right” and we are hard pressed to
                  explain exactly why.

                  Working off this conceptual framework, I offer the following:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>MARKETING MESSAGE - BEFORE</h3>
                <br>
                <p>“Stadio specializes in helping businesses monetize their Wi-Fi. Our wireless
                  technology is effective and competitively priced. Our software is designed to help
                  your customers utilize their mobile devices and we provide fan engagement and vital
                  customer analytics.
                  Do you want to buy our product?”</p>
                <br>
                <h3>MARKETING MESSAGE - AFTER</h3>
                <br>
                <p>“everything we do is driven by our passion to connect people. The best moments in life should be shared, and we believe that bringing people together is an essential need. We support this idea by; helping customers utilize their mobile devices, and businesses engage their followers, gain analytics and monetize their Wi-Fi. We just happen to sell effective and competitively priced wireless technology. Want to buy one?”</p>
                <br>
                <!-- <h3>Category</h3> -->
                <br>
                <p>Feel the difference? This is why – in my opinion – Stadio needs to share its
                  goal on an emotional-level FIRST. Then share how its products/services accomplish
                  that goal. This emotional-level message needs to be delivered consistently in every
                  sales pitch, website page, printed material, advertisement, etc.

                  When a customer uses Stadio, they are doing something social and fun; while
                  at a game, a concert, a restaurant, doing fun things. Stadio needs to carry
                  this spirit into the center of its brand.


                  Stadio won’t sell itself to a business because it’s what the business wants,
                  but rather because it’s what the customers want. Stadio can differentiate itself
                  by engaging with its customers in such a way that they feel emotionally connected
                  to the brand.


                  A business needs to differentiate itself by engaging with its customers, connecting
                  with them socially and causing an emotional reaction through its communications.
                  This emotional connection is what drives people to take action. The social era will
                  reward those who realize they can’t create this value by themselves. This is where
                  Stadio comes in.</p>

                <p>We were contacted and asked if we were interested in this 70
                  year old dead American Elm that was destined for the chipper.
                  In January of 2017 we took a day off of our real-jobs and acted
                  like lumberjacks, milling this gorgeous material into usable slabs.
                  The material is now air-drying, and will be our next big project when
                  it's finally dry enough to use.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This dead and fallen sycamore was foundin the canyons of University City, in San Diego,
                  rotting amongst the bugs and foliage. We decided to bring up a small section of this tree
                  and attempt to create something beautiful from it's remants that were destined to decompose.
                  The result was an incredible hands-on learning experience about lumber, milling, moisture
                  content, slabbing, and air drying rough lumber into a beautiful fine piece of furniture.</p>
